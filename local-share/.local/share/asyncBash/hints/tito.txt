To make a new release:

0-Commit local changes 
1-tito tag 
And this create a new local tag with an automatic message 
2-git checkout stable  (the releases branch)
3-git merge master or git merge tag-name 
4-Just push it all to github 
git push --all
git push --tags
5-Create a new release from the tag in github (in stable)
6- Make one more remote commit (in any branch) to actually launch a new release in copr for the new release Â¿? 
(Using an old delivery doesn't work either :( )


GOTCHAS:

You must use the push event in the github webhooks.
I'll be great to be able to use the release event o anything else
but copr is not prepared for that so before any commit in any branch a 
build will be released. :((((
